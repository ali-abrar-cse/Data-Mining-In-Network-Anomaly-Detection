# Data-Mining-In-Network-Anomaly-Detection
# Abstract
We are surrounded by uncountable data in every aspects of our life. The value of those are immeasurable. In this era of internet, data is the main key. Our data is floating. In every moment huge volume of data is sending and receiving. Even though there are lots of mechanism is working for saving those, but during the transferring process data can be looted. There are lots of ways to find or create vulnerabilities. From the very beginning of internet, the intruders are always there. Lots of Intrusion Detection System (IRS) have been introduced to trace them. To build these Data Mining technique played emerging role to heal the vulnerabilities. The IRS need to be up to date as the technology also developing. As always, lots of new data mining frameworks are inventing and those are playing amazing role to detect anomalies. This paper reviews the Data Mining frameworks, Algorithms of recent researches along with those accuracy and flexibility in anomaly or intrusion detection which may help the new researcher to understand the current scenario for their work in this field.
